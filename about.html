		<h1 class="title">About Sam Jiji</h1>
		<p style="font-size:22px">I am 19 years old. I was born on the 15th of September 2001 in Kerala, India. I moved to the UK when I was around 2 years old and lived in Esssex for a few months before coming and staying in Nottingham. I have always had an interest in technology ever since I was a child. When I first got a computer I spent hours learning how to use it and understanding its functionality. Since then m fascnination of computer science had increased. I enjoye programming but doing anything with computers. I studied Computer Science at GCSE & A-level. I also spent most of my time watching anime and movies. I listen to a wide variety of music, I have no specific taste other then if it sounds good i'll listen to it.</p>
