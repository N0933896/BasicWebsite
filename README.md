## Basic Website | About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This website was created as a part of my computer science module, where I studied the basics of HTML & CSS. I was able to add in information and other details to create a minimalist website. 

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks/libraries used:

* [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
* [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html)
