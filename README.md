## Basic Website | About The Project

![Website](images/https://gcdn.pbrd.co/images/JUhjgY0W53CH.png?o=1)


This website was created as a part of my computer science module, where I studied the basics of HTML & CSS. I was able to add in information and other details to create a minimalist website. 

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks/libraries used:

* [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
* [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html)

### Running Webiste

As the website is stored locally any user who wishes to view the webpages you have to open the index file.

* open the html file
  ```sh
  index.html
  ```
